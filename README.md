# Odin_Restaurant
**Frieren CafÃ©** a functional multi page Restaurant website using WebPack to bundle files.

**Live demo** : https://northsurapee.github.io/Odin_Restaurant/
 
 ## WebPack Notes :
 - "WebPack" is node modules to bundle files!
 - This project initialized as Node.js project with "package.json" metadata file
 - "package.json" include "npm run push" script to push just production folder of all stuff we push to main to the production branch (git push -> npm run push)
 - I already install WebPack CLI to the node_modules, So we can use WebPack command.
 - "npx webpack" and "npx webpack" (auto build) is use to build bundles file to the production folder (dist).
 - I got initial webpack.config.js file from tutorial and need to change mode from "development" to "production" when deploy to optimize it.
